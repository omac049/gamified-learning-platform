## üì¶ Semantic Release

### Configuration (`.releaserc.json`)

**Branch Strategy:**

- `main` ‚Üí Production releases
- `develop` ‚Üí Beta pre-releases

**Commit Types & Release Impact:**

- `feat:` ‚Üí Minor version bump
- `fix:`, `perf:`, `revert:`, `refactor:` ‚Üí Patch version bump
- `docs:`, `style:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:` ‚Üí No release

**Generated Sections:**

- üöÄ Features
- üêõ Bug Fixes
- ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Code Refactoring
- üìö Documentation

**Automated Actions:**

- CHANGELOG.md updates
- Package.json version bumping
- Git tagging and commits
- GitHub release creation
- PR/Issue commenting

## üåê Deployment Configuration

### Netlify Setup (`netlify.toml`)

**Build Settings:**

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Node.js 18 environment

**Security Headers:**

- Content Security Policy
- XSS Protection
- Frame Options
- Content Type Options

**Performance Optimization:**

- Long-term caching for assets
- Immutable cache headers
- SPA redirect handling

**Environment Contexts:**

- Production: Full optimization
- Deploy Preview: Development mode
- Branch Deploy: Development mode

## üîç Performance Monitoring

### Lighthouse CI (`.lighthouserc.json`)

**Audit Thresholds:**

- Performance: 80% (warning)
- Accessibility: 90% (error)
- Best Practices: 80% (warning)
- SEO: 80% (warning)

**Configuration:**

- 3 test runs for accuracy
- Chrome flags for CI environment
- Temporary public storage for reports

## üìä Available Scripts
