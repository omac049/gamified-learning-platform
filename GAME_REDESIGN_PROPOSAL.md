# ü§ñ CYBER ACADEMY: CHARACTER BUILD INTEGRATION PROPOSAL

## üéØ **VISION: Transform Math Learning into Epic Robot Combat**

Instead of separate character customization and math games, we'll create a unified experience where:

- **Character builds directly affect math battle performance**

```javascript
// Question appears as "attack opportunity"
displayMathQuestion(difficulty);
startTimer(baseTime + speedBonus);
enableHints(accuracyLevel);
```

#### **Phase 3: Combat Resolution**

```javascript
if (answerCorrect) {
  damage = baseDamage * attackMultiplier;
  playerRobot.attack(weaponType);
  enemyRobot.takeDamage(damage);
  awardScore(damage);
} else {
  penalty = basePenalty - defenseReduction;
  enemyRobot.attack();
  playerRobot.takeDamage(penalty);
  applyPenalty(penalty);
}
```

#### **Phase 4: Victory/Continue**

```javascript
if (enemyDefeated) {
